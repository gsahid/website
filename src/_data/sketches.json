On the first day, I stayed in Rifugio Biella. As much as I would have loved to sketch outdoors, we happened to have a snowstorm the night before, so it was really cold when I got there, so I decided to sketch mountains from the comfort of the rifugio instead while enjoying two(!) cups of hot chocolate."

The number of times I actually slipped was embarrassing. The moment I stepped into my hut, it started raining heavily, and there was a thunderstorm throughout the night.
